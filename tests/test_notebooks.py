"""Guards for the notebooks this repo tracks: the demo notebooks, and every run-book.

`notebooks/build_images.ipynb` is the how-to for building the two AML node images, and
is deliberately public (`.gitignore` un-ignores it explicitly). Every other notebook stays
ignored precisely because notebooks leak: a saved output carries whatever the cell printed,
and cloud tooling prints subscription ids, tenant ids, workspace URLs and home directories
without being asked.

So the exception needs teeth. These tests are the reason the file can be tracked at all:

  * no saved outputs and no execution counts -- an executed notebook must be cleared before
    it is committed (Kernel > Restart & Clear All Outputs);
  * no identifiers in the source -- the private values come from
    `~/.config/fsd/config.toml` (spec 54) at run time, never from the file itself.

**Blob paths are the one exception (user, 2026-09-29).** A storage account, container or
`abfss://` path may be written into a notebook directly: it grants nothing without a
credential, and routing it through an environment variable was judged clunky. Everything
else above stays forbidden -- GUIDs (subscription / tenant / client ids), email addresses,
home directories, resource-group / workspace / cluster names.

**Run-books are notebooks too (spec 24 A1).** Every `runbooks/*.ipynb` is tracked (only
`notebooks/*.ipynb` is gitignored), so each one gets the same two guards by glob -- a new
run-book is covered the moment it exists. Two more rules are theirs alone (A1.5): the notebook
names its kernel, and it checks which `fsd` it imported.

Synthetic and offline: this reads the checked-in JSON, it never runs a cell.
